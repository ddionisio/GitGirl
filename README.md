GitGirl
=======

Expanding on the Github Game-Off project with more experiments.  I just felt like it needed to be finished.

About The Game
==============

GitGirl employs the power of her hair to resolve all the conflicts that plague across the vast repositories of GitHub.  With the power of her Intergalactic Space-Hair, she can push and pull her way into victory.

##Tools Used
* Unity 3D
* Adobe Photoshop
* Notepad++

##Third-Party Libraries
* NGUI - Neat Unity UI tool.  <http://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140>. You need a licensed version of this in order to compile the code in this repository.
* 2D Toolkit - 2D tools for building 2D games in Unity. <http://www.unikronsoftware.com/2dtoolkit/>.  You need a licensed version of this in order to compile the code in this repository.
* fastJSON - JSON serializer for C#. <http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/159450/fastJSON>.

##Project Setup
Requires Unity 3D 4.

In order to setup the project:
* Clone this repository
* Open the project in Unity 3D
* In Unity, import the two plugins: NGUI (tested with 2.3.6) and Toolkit2D (tested with 1.91final)
* Once both plugins are imported, from the menu, look for M8, then click on 'Meta GUID Restore'
* Look for Assets/guids.txt in the Project view and drag it to the box next to 'Select'
* You will notice that two buttons will appear: 'Generate' and 'Restore'
* Click on 'Restore', cross your fingers
* Once that's done, Unity will re-import assets. All should be well at this point
* Check any prefabs or scenes to see if there are missing references, hopefully there's none...Otherwise it may be that certain script files no longer exist if you imported from a higher version of NGUI and/or Toolkit 2D. You'll have to resolve those manually.
